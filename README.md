Build your perfect face to find love. 

A dating site where you build your ideal person by dragging and dropping facial characteristics on to a model and then comparing that model to pictures in our database to find you your perfect match.

The technologies we used was Postgres, Imgur API, React Drag and Drop, Face-api.js, React, Redux, Material UI, Express and much more. We learned how to use third party API's. We learned a little bit about machine learning and combining NPM packages to make them work for us.
